                                    <p>This is NEUE's fearless leader. He's bold. He's experienced. And he definitely knows what he's doing. With Jerry at the helm, NEUE can only head in one direction: forward. Jerry's technique may be classical. (After all, he was trained by Vidal Sassoon and Jingles International in London, and that's always a good thing.) But his styling is modern and constantly updated from his many involvements in global trade events. The result is a stylist who can boast the foundation and expertise of a veteran, and the unexpected creativity of a millennial. With such skills, it's no wonder the Brunei royal family had asked him to be their personal stylist for a whopping 13 years! He's not flying to Brunei anymore – he's got his own royal family to take care of – which means he's yours ... all yours!</p>
